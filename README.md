# Hi!

I'm exercising my mind by making a static site generator just like I want it. There are many ([list](https://gist.github.com/davatron5000/2254924), [list](http://blog.bmannconsulting.com/node-static-site-generators/)) already out there. This isn't to compete, this is just some self sufficency and some weekend JavaScripting fun times.

#### Basics

- Written in the pure, classic and elegant language JavaScript, using [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org).
- Uses [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) for templating.
- **No front matter**. Ability to leave blog posts in pure markdown format, for easy printing and linking-to/reading/downloading.
 - Post metadata is parsed from the common post headers (below), just make sure your lines coorelate and tags are separated with commas (you can have any varient of markdown header hashes):

```
# Title
### Author
### Date
### Tags

Hi this is a post. So pancake.
```
- Site metadata and template designation happens in `config.json`. You can link files or directories to a template.

### Get Running

    git clone https://github.com/jlord/balrog.git
    cd balrog

Edit `config.json` then make some posts and stuff.

    npm run build

Then you'll have your static files and RSS feed. Woo!

If you want to run a test server to try out your site, you can do

    npm run server

and if you want to build & run at the same time you can do

    npm start

### Structure

- **root** you can put .html or .md files in the root directory. These are for the purpose of pages such as about, contact and whatnots. _All .html and .md files will be parsed except for readme.md_ [for now](https://github.com/jlord/balrog/issues/5).
- **assets** folder to contain subfolders for **css**, **imgs** or **js**. All of its contents are copied directly to the final `site` folder.
- **posts** place your markdown post/blog files here. _No spaces in the filename._
- **shared** contains your template partials/includes such as _header_ or _footer_ HTML files.
- **templates** contains your main template/layout files written in HTML and containing at least `{{content}}` but can also contain partials/includes such as `{{> header}}` which will include a header.html file from the shared folder.
- **node_modules** holds all the nodes.
- **site** this is the folder generated by the program and what will contain the static files for the site (place them on a gh-pages branch for a live website). It will have `assets` and `blog` as its subfolders, other pages will be in its root.

#### Other Files

- **config.json** a .JSON file with site meta data in it and template designations. You can link files or directories to a template.

```json
{
  "site_route": "/site",
  "site_url": "http://www.site.com/",
  "site_title": "cool pizza",
  "site_description": "wow",
  "site_author": "helloworld",
  "icon": "icon.png",
  "ignores": ["license, readme"],
  "templates": {
    "flat-page": ["about", "contact", "index"],
    "single-post": ["/posts/*.md"]
  }
}
```

- **index.html** you'll want at least this in your root directory.
- **rss.xml** is generated afresh when you run `node index.js`
- **license, readme.md** docs
- **index.js, meta,js** the main files for executing all this stuff. meta.js generates the metadata and RSS.

#### Future

For now, if you want to host this on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) you'll have to copy the generated `site` folder into a branch named `gh-pages`. I'm planning on getting it going on Heroku or such and will need to create a little server doodad. I'll also probably generate some JSON for all the post data so that I can do other nifty stuff with it.
